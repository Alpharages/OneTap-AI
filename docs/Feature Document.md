# Feature Document

## 1\. Introduction

This document details the key features of Promptly, a mobile AI-powered application designed to enhance digital communication and learning. It elaborates on the core functionalities, user interactions, and high-level technical considerations for each feature, building upon the "Concept Note" and "Product Requirements Document."

## 2\. Feature Details

### 2.1. Text Selection Overlay

- **Description**: This feature enables users to activate Promptly's AI capabilities by simply selecting text within any mobile application (e.g., messaging apps, browsers, email clients). It provides a non-intrusive, on-screen interface for initiating AI actions.
- **Core Functionality**:
    - **System-Level Integration**: Promptly will detect text selection events across the operating system.
    - **Contextual Menu/Floating Button**: Upon text selection, a small, discreet Promptly icon or a contextual menu option will appear near the selected text.
    - **Activation**: Tapping the icon or selecting the menu option will open Promptly's mini-interface or a prompt input field.
    - **Dismissal**: The overlay should be easily dismissible without interrupting the user's current app.
- **User Flow (High-Level)**:
    1.  User selects text in any app (e.g., long-press, drag handles).
    2.  Promptly's floating icon/menu option appears.
    3.  User taps the Promptly icon.
    4.  Promptly's mini-interface opens with the selected text pre-loaded.
- **Technical Considerations (High-Level)**:
    - **Android**: Requires `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission for floating overlays and accessibility services for text detection.
    - **iOS**: May involve custom keyboard extensions, share sheet extensions, or leveraging Universal Clipboard and content recognition APIs. System-wide floating overlays are more restrictive on iOS.
    - **Performance**: Must be lightweight to avoid impacting the performance of other apps.
- **Dependencies**: Operating system accessibility/overlay APIs, text recognition capabilities.

### 2.2. Custom Prompting

- **Description**: This feature allows users to provide specific instructions to the AI for processing the selected text, enabling a wide range of text transformations (e.g., tone refinement, summarization, expansion).
- **Core Functionality**:
    - **Prompt Input Field**: A dedicated text input area within Promptly's mini-interface where users can type their desired prompt.
    - **Pre-defined Prompts (Optional)**: A list of common prompt suggestions (e.g., "Make it professional," "Summarize," "Expand," "Simplify") for quick access.
    - **AI Processing**: The selected text and the user's prompt are sent to an AI model for generation.
    - **Output Display**: The AI-generated output is displayed clearly within Promptly's interface.
    - **Copy/Replace Options**: Users can easily copy the output or replace the original selected text with the new output (where technically feasible, e.g., within a custom keyboard).
- **User Flow (High-Level)**:
    1.  User activates Promptly via Text Selection Overlay (as above).
    2.  Promptly's interface opens, showing the selected text.
    3.  User types a custom prompt (e.g., "Change to a friendly tone") or selects a pre-defined prompt.
    4.  User taps "Generate" or similar button.
    5.  AI processes the request and displays the result.
    6.  User can copy the result or apply it.
- **Technical Considerations (High-Level)**:
    - **AI Integration**: Integration with large language models (LLMs) via APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT API, Gemini API).
    - **API Key Management**: Secure handling of API keys (if applicable and user-configurable).
    - **Rate Limiting/Cost Management**: Mechanisms to manage API usage and potential costs.
    - **Asynchronous Processing**: AI generation should be asynchronous with loading indicators to maintain responsiveness.
